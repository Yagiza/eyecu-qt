eyeCU
-----
Full-featured crossplatform Jabber/XMPP client, a Vacuum-IM fork. The core program is just a plugin loader, all functionality is made available via plugins. This enforces modularity and ensures well defined component interaction via interfaces. The main idea of eyeCU is improving Jabbercommunication by adding geolocation-oriented features, like Map, Positioning and Points of Interest with an ability to exchange location with your buddies. The second is implementation of mordern advanced XMPP extensions, like Personal Events (PEP), XHTML-IM, Message Delivery Receipts, Attention and so on.
